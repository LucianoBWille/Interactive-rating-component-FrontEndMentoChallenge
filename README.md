## My process

- I put the design image in the background of the body
- I wrote the HTML with the content
- Then I put opacity on the container section, so I could see the image behind the content
- Seeing the design behind the content I was able to fit the style to be as faithful as possible.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

Two tools that I intend to use for future projects:
1. Figma: rebuild the design layout to aid in development.
2. SASS: to make the CSS more optimized
